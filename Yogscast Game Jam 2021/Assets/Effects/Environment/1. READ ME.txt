Here's a breakdown of where these sounds should go:


box_push_loop
	- fairly obvious, have the sound loop whenever player is pushing a box

crow_alive
	- for when the torch revives a dead bird, sound is synced to assumed 0.69 
	  revive time

crow_death
	- for when the bird reverts to being dead from not being in the torch light

crumble noise
	- for when platforms revert back to being broken from not being in torch light

darkworld_noise
	- for when the darkworld begins after the girl under the lamp talks to player

door_unlock
	- for when the pressure plate puzzle is complete and the house door opens

human_alive
	- for when the girl under the lamp comes back to life, I don't think there's 
	  any time in game where you visually see a human die aside from the lamp girl,
	  but darkworld_noise should play then so I didn't think we needed a human dead
	  noise

item_ping
	- should play when they player sees an important item, like the torch or the 
	  seeds from the bird alongside a visual twinkle to let them know its important

jumping
	- when player jumps

landing
	- when player hits ground after a jump

lifelight_loop
	- should begin to loop after player picks up the torch, and then loop until end
	  of the game

lightbulb_crack
	- I wasn't sure if we were making the intro cutscene or not, but if we are this 
	  sound should play once the player begins the game as the light above them in 
	  the room cracks and turns off ("I should go get a new lightbulb")

lightbulb_loop
	- For if the intro cutscene is made this can loop until the player hits play 
	  and then the lightbulb cracks and game commences

plant_grow
	- for when the player grows the seed in the plant pot, sound is synced to an 
	  assumed 0.69 second grow time

pressure_plate
	- for when a pressure plate is activated in the plate puzzle

rebuild_noise
	- for when the player rebuilds the crumbled platforms, sound is synced to 0.69

speech_bubble_1
speech_bubble_2
	- couldnt decide which is more fitting, so I'll let you guys see once its in 
	  game

streetlamp_on
	- for when the streetlamp over the girl turns on after darkworld begins, should 
	  be followed shortly by human_alive to show girl being revived

torch_off
torch_on
	- i trust u guys to know this one lol

walking_loop
	- loop whenever player is moving

wind_ambiance_loop
	- to be looped once darkworld has begun until player collects torch, should then
	  be replaced by lifelight_loop

wind_and_birds_ambiance_loop
	- to be played during lightworld section of game, the reason i made two 
	  different ambiance loops is that the birds would have died in darkworld so I 
	  figured a wind loop without birds once it begins would be thematically
	  appropriate


Let me know if you need any more sound effects or if you need a better explanation for 
any :D

for the sounds to do with the torch rebuilding something i wasnt sure if i should have 
a transitional sound that plays when the torch is shining on something and then a 
seperate "complete transformation" sound so that the complete transformation sound 
doesnt get cut off when the player moves the torch off it, but I've baked the two 
together which is why theyre synced to a shorter time than the actual file (e.g. 0.69)
so lmk if u need them seperate of if they're fine as is
