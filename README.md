**Story**

Ever just sit in your room and stare at your flickering lightbulb?

...No?  Well, me neither since it broke a second ago...

Nothing good comes out of sitting in the dark, guess I oughta go buy a new one.

What day is it again?  January 25th?  Why do I feel like that's important...

Oh well, time to head out.

**Gameplay**

The light is your friend in this single player puzzle game where the sun has mysteriously vanished, leaving everything that was once alive now dead, and everything that was intact now in ruin.

Only artificial light remains, let's hope it can light the way home and restore some of what has been taken...

**Developer Comments**

This game was our entry for the 7-day Winter 2021 Yogscast Gamejam which used the prompt 'opposites', the core design and gameplay was developed collaboratively by all four members of our team. The game is not entirely finished, unfortunately, so don't be too critical of the bugs :)

The last puzzle has a bug where it only appears to "transform" objects once. You might need a restart if you seem to be stuck.
